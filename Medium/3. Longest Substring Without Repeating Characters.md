## Description

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest**

**substring**

without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

# Approach :

- Time complexity: `O(n)`
- Space complexity: `O(n)`<br />
where `n` is the length of the string

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        i,j = 0,0
        seen = {}
        longest = 0
        while j < len(s):
            if s[j] in seen.keys():
                i = max(seen[s[j]] + 1, i)
            seen[s[j]] = j
            longest = max(longest, j - i + 1)
            j += 1
        return longest
```
